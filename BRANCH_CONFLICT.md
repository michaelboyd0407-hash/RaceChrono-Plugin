# Branch conflict explanation

The `work` branch introduces a brand new `RaceChrono_v1_5` module that contains
fresh copies of all plugin sources, including `src/main/java/com/mboyd/racechrono/RaceChrono.java`.
On the upstream branch, maintainers have already committed their own `RaceChrono_v1_5`
implementation. Because both branches create the same paths independently,
Git cannot fast-forward or auto-merge the histories; it reports a branch conflict
as soon as the pull request is opened.

To publish the PR you need to reconcile your files with the upstream versionâ€”either
by rebasing onto the latest upstream commit and resolving the conflicting files, or by
removing the duplicate module before pushing and re-applying your changes on top of the
maintainers' copy. Once the duplicate additions are resolved, the conflict will disappear.
